Honestly, this project was really difficult for me. I had to look to your code for a lot of help. However, looking back now, I fully understand what this code means, and believe I could replicate it again if asked. I did not change much because my project was already pretty good (I had asked you for some help) except I made it a bar graph. I switched it from ovals to rectangles because honestly it just makes it more visually appealing. I edited code in the draw function.
